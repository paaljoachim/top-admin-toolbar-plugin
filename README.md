Top admin toolbar dropdown icons - Inspired by the toolbar feature plugin

I am working on the following WordPress trac ticket: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678
Wireframes have been created by Davide Folletto - Admin Bar Unified Concept i10. 

In the frontend I now have a drop down containing the various backend main sections and the dashicons.
