# top-admin-toolbar-plugin
Inspired by the following WordPress trac ticket: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678
and wireframes created by Davide Folletto - Admin Bar Unified Concept i10. I decided to create this plugin as an addition to: https://github.com/helenhousandi/wp-toolbar-experiments

In the frontend I now have a drop down containing the various backend main sections and the dashicons.
